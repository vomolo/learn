* Navigate to the project directory.

* Install the required dependencies 
``by installing go mod file to the prigram i.e go mod init then go mod tidy to add missing module dependencies and to ensure that the file is updated with the correct version of these dependencies.``

* Run the program.

## Usage

``  Run the program using the following command: "go run main.go go run . [STRING] [BANNER] Example: go run . something standard"``


    Replace <STRING> with the desired string you want to convert to ASCII art and <BANNER> with the path to the font file with the desired string.
